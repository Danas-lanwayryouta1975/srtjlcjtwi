Okay, so I just stumbled out of the theater after watching Bring Her Back, and I’m caught between needing a cup of coffee and... trying to untangle whatever just happened. You know when you take out a load of laundry and there’s that one sock that just doesn’t make sense in the mix? That's this movie. It's like, did it really match with the other stuff, or was it a mistake to begin with? Ugh.

Seriously though, Bring Her Back is like watching a blender with the lid off — you're just hoping you don’t have to clean up the mess afterwards. It's all going fine and then BOOM, plot twist. Or was it a plot twister…? Can't decide if I’m annoyed or intrigued. Maybe both? Anyhoo, there's this one scene where the lead actress, bless her heart, tries to convey every emotion known to mankind in like... 15 seconds. And here I am, as confused as my cat trying to chase its own tail.

> Maybe there's some deeper meaning I missed. Or maybe my brain is just too fried from refereeing my kids to catch it all. Watch it, they said. It'll be fun, they said. And they lied. Or didn’t — I’m still figuring that part out.

Oh, and what's with the soundtrack? It was like someone dipped my grandma’s old vinyl in hipster juice and called it good. Half the time, I was more focused on whether the music actually synced with what was on screen or if someone accidentally hit shuffle. I won’t even start on the CGI — or lack thereof. Felt like baking a cake and forgetting the sugar.

Okay, sidebar: there’s this bit of dialogue where one character rambles about parakeets or something while the world, apparently, is ending around them. Such a mood, right? Wouldn't put it past my life, honestly. Highlight of the film, really.

def bring_her_back(heart):
    if heart == ‘lost’:
        return ‘search’
    else:
        return ‘hope’

For what it's worth, maybe try downloading the movie when it’s out or whatever. Or not. It’s like that dish you keep trying at family gatherings — you need to see if it’s still as weird as you remember. Just don’t say I didn’t warn you! Now, where's my coffee...
